# copy-tab-link-extension

A simple browser extension that adds an item to a tab's context menu in Firefox to copy the tab's URL to the clipboard.

_Note that at this time the extension is not actually available in the Add-Ons store. It also has not been tested on browsers other than Firefox 97 on Windows, though it should be usable anywhere._
